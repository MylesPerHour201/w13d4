Bubble Sort has the worst overall performance due to its nested loops that compare all elements in every pass, even if the list is nearly sorted.
Selection Sort and Insertion Sort have similar average and worst-case complexities (O(n^2)), but they can perform better in the best case (O(n)) when the list is already sorted (Selection Sort) or partially sorted (Insertion Sort).
Selection Sort has slightly fewer swaps compared to Bubble Sort but requires the same number of comparisons in most cases.
Insertion Sort performs fewer comparisons than both Bubble Sort and Selection Sort in the average case.
The number of swaps for Insertion Sort is usually close to the number of comparisons.
Preferred Scenarios:

For small datasets: Any of these algorithms might be suitable due to the relatively small execution time. However, Insertion Sort might be a better choice due to its potentially lower number of comparisons.
For nearly sorted datasets: Selection Sort might be a good choice because it can take advantage of the partial order and potentially achieve O(n) complexity.
For larger datasets or when frequent sorting is needed: Consider more efficient sorting algorithms like Merge Sort (O(n log n)) or Quick Sort (average O(n log n), worst case O(n^2)) for better performance.
